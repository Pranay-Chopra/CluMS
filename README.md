CluMS (or Club Management Software) is a proprietary software developed by [FORCE-Club](github.com/FORCE-Fest) for managing the members, teams and events organized and contained within the club.

# Back Story
The project was initially intended as the Grade 12 CBSE Computer Science project of the club leaders [Pranay Chopra](github.com/Pranay-Chopra) and [Neil Virmani](github.com/NVirCX) for AY 2024-25. However, due to its highly practical use case and its almost flawless nature, it was quickly adopted by the club and is now in use as the Official Club Management System.

# General Info and Documentation
1. The Software is built for [![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?logo=linux&logoColor=black)](Linux.org) ONLY and works with [![GTK - 3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/GTK-3.0-green?logo=gtk)](https://gtk.org) The maintainers are working on a [![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) port, but so far there has been no positive progress made towards it. The UI looks good in DARK MODE ONLY, and it is recommended you use [![Theme - Flat-Remix-XXX-Darkest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Theme-Flat--Remix--XXX--Darkest-191919?logo=gnome)](https://github.com/daniruiz/Flat-Remix-Gtk)

2. The app works on password authentication. Right now, there is only one user and it is hardcoded into the app. For the future, however, the maintainers are working on a User Management System.
